# React_Js
Here i learned some REACT concepts like jsx, components, props, states, react hooks, react-router etc. I got the idea of how we can make different components and can reuse it by just wrting only the component name & we can send props also within it. Thus we can write less code. I knew the concept of single page web application i.e. page will not reload but the content will be changed.
